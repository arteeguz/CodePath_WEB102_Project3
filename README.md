## Notes

The hardest part is adding the shuffle feature for the cards. It's tricky because you need to understand a specific shuffling method to mix up the cards correctly. Also, making sure the app keeps track of the new order of the cards and shows this change to the user can be quite challenging. Plus, you have to test it carefully to make sure the shuffle is truly random.
